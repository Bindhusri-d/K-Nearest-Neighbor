# K-Nearest-Neighbor
K-nearest neighbor(K-NN) algorithm basically creates an imaginary boundary to classify the data. When new data points come in, the algorithm will try to predict that to the nearest of the boundary line. Therefore, larger k value means smother curves of separation resulting in less complex models.
